Arch Door:

Use an animation curve for the arch, instead of the quadratic curve being used currently.

Here is some sample code I wrote:

                AnimationCurve archCurve = new AnimationCurve();

                int archLOD = 10;

                float[] curveSamplePoints = new float[archLOD];

                float timeStep = 1 / archLOD;
                float samplePoint = 0;

                for(int k = 0; k < archLOD; k++)
                {
                    curveSamplePoints[i] = archCurve.Evaluate(samplePoint);
                    samplePoint += timeStep;
                }

The sample points are the height modifier for the arch.

Polygon Recoginition

Shape profiles.

In a seperate project, I've created a system for loading in a set of image files. These files store data

pretaining to a shape. The system can then recognise if an organised set of control points match one of the loaded shapes.

I want to integrate that system into this project. And replace the existing system of having built in shape profiles stored.

An issue with this, is that the gable data (midline points, tile indices, extend indices, wall indices) is tied to those in-built data structures.

Index data could be stored in a csv file.

Most of the midline point are midway points between 2 control points, however some require an instersection method to calculate.

If we stored the mid-line data to a file. How would we desern between the calc points & lerp points?
