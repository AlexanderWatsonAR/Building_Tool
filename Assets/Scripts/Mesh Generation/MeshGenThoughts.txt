Arch Door:

Use an animation curve for the arch, instead of the quadratic curve being used currently.

Here is some sample code I wrote:

                AnimationCurve archCurve = new AnimationCurve();

                int archLOD = 10;

                float[] curveSamplePoints = new float[archLOD];

                float timeStep = 1 / archLOD;
                float samplePoint = 0;

                for(int k = 0; k < archLOD; k++)
                {
                    curveSamplePoints[i] = archCurve.Evaluate(samplePoint);
                    samplePoint += timeStep;
                }

The sample points are the height modifier for the arch.
