A building could receive different scriptable objects in the custom editor:
- Building Data object, contains control points, number of storeys, roof type etc.
- Style data, a list of materials for different components.

How could I store data relating to the inside of the building?

I think on reflection, the style data works with scriptable objects but the building data really
relates to specific game objects & shouldn't be made into a scriptbale object.

Polygon Recognition
The polygon recognition functions are mostly doing the same thing:
	- Looking for concave points.
	- checking for the number of concave points
	- checking for the number of control points
	- checking if certain points in the poly path, relative to a concave point, are or aren't concave points.

Data relevant to individual shape profiles could be saved in a file.

Checking the shape profile for a repeating shape is slightly different than checking a static one.

This will need to connect to the gable data, as that relates to specific shapes.

I've began implementing the Opening Data base & sub classes.

The data classes are pretty much done.

However, I need to start connecting that those data classes to the buildable so they can be initialized & used.

The serialized properties classes will also have to be changed.
 - we just need to update where the accessors point to. If we add or remove any accessors, we will also have to change the property drawer.
