Polygon3D alt class 


Idea: Presently, the control points of a shape, although represent a polygon,

have differing size, position & rotation. This is a result of how the points were generated.

Consequently, when we want to apply functions to a polygon, such as detection or splitting a polygon,

we are required to "undo" those transformations. 

Alternatively, we can store those transformations separately & only apply them when constructing a mesh.
